<h1>IMAGE EDITOR WEBSITE </h1>

<h3>1. Home :</h3>

The home section starts with a button displaying “Get Started”,  which will direct the user to the Image editor section. <br>
After that we have three cards which display the process of image editing. <br>
Then there is a section which describes all the editing features that we have used in our image editor like grayscale, contrast, saturate and many more.  <br>
We have used image transition to show how the specific editing feature works and have provided a short description for it as well.
After that comes the main editor. Here we have a Canvas in which a user can upload the image he wants to edit with the help of choose button. On the left, there are various sliders and buttons which the user can use to edit the image.<br>
After applying the desired editing filters, the user can click on the Download button to download a copy of the edited image and save it.
If the user wants to revert back to the original image then he/she can click on the Reset button and if the user wants to upload a new image on the canvas he/she can click on the Clear Canvas button which will clear the canvas, after that he/she can click on the choose button to select new image.

<h1>TOOLS USED :</h2>

We have used HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT for making this website. We have implemented all the editing features and the logic used for implementing these features like saturate, contrast, invert etc  using java-script only. Also, we have used simple image library for drawing the image to canvas.
For the frontend part, we have implemented everything using simple HTML, CSS and JS, involving different sets of animation used, transitions given to particular blocks, fixed navbar and many more.
For the backend part, we have a contact form in the contact section, which is linked to a google form, and any response recorded will be stored automatically in an excel sheet via this form. So, we have all the necessary information and valuable feedbacks of the users who fill this form.


<h1>FLOW OF PROJECT:</h1>

At the top there is a navbar with which user can navigate to home, about us and contact us pages. The “Get Started”  button at the top of the home page takes the user to the editor section.
